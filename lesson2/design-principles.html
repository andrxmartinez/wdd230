    <p>
    As we can see in the screenshot, the Apple's website includes a picture and a quote 
    with big letters, which is a great usage of Visual Hierarchy. They clearly want all users 
    to focus first on this message about transformation and then proceed to do the corresponding
    searches.

        The Nike's website has a lot of white spaces combined with pictures of their catalog. As we 
        can see in the screenshot, they have their different categories,followed by a picture of their 
        corresponding products. To me, this is a great example of not focusing on having so much text, 
        but instead, using white space with pictures and a proper and user friendly design.

    <p>
        I chose spotify's website as a good example of contrast because of the way they play with the colors 
        and textures. They are definitely innovative, yet, they adhere to contrast standards while creating 
        a new concept for users. To me this is a great way of adding contrast to a website.
